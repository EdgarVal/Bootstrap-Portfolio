                            <p>My name is Edgar Valenzuela. Im 30 years old, born in southern California but moved out to Arizona my senior 
                                of high school. Im more used to it here now than before, but still not used to the summers. Im Hispanic-American
                                and both my parents are from Mexico but moved to the states before I was born.
                            </p>

                            <p>I have a lot of hobbies an interest. As I stated above, Im really big into sports or almost all kinds. But also big into music, video games,
                                movies and shows, gotten very skilled and passionate about cooking, animals, travleing, etc. Juts about anything thats gonna give me a new 
                                experience and a sense of the possiblities has to offer. Now as I purse my life and hopefully my career towards becoming a web programmer,
                                thats stands more true that ever right now.
                            </p>
